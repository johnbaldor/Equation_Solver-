This program reads lines of math equations between two rational numbers off of one or more input files. The Program recognizes the operator in the equations and performs the operation to calculate the result of the read equation. The read equation along with the rational result is printed to an output file.


To compile the program, run the command:
gcc -c test_rational.c -o test_rational.o




To run the program, run the command:
./rational_math input_file.txt output_file.txt
